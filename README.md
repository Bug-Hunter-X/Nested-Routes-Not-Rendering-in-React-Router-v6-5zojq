This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router v6. The problem lies in how nested routes are defined and handled, leading to unexpected rendering behavior.

The `App.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `AppSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.  The core issue involves ensuring the correct structure and usage of the `Routes` and `Route` components from `react-router-dom` to properly handle nested navigation.

This example includes a simple Home component, About component, and NotFound component for demonstration purposes.
